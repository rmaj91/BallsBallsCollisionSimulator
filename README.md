# BallsCollisionSimulator
Simple balls collision simulator in JavaFX. It's not perfect but works pretty well.
### Features
- U can create new balls by left mouse click if u drag cursor before releasing u add velocity vector to the current ball.
- Click "W" to increase ball radius and "S" do decrease. 
- It's possible to delete new added balls(but only while simulation is stopped), just right click on them.
- U can manipulate Earth acceleration by spinner control
- Create balls in different colors :D 
- And of course clear balls in simulation and start fun again :)
- Be aware if u resize window u loose all balls(this is semi protection i'll change this in future)

I think it's all. Good fun! :) for me it's really cool :D

**TODO** many many things....
